# Emergency Medical Conditions

## Acute Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack)

Occurs when blood flow to part of the heart muscle is blocked, usually by a blood clot in a coronary artery.

**Typical presentation:** Chest pain or pressure (described as squeezing, heaviness, tightness), radiating to left arm, jaw, neck, or back. Associated with diaphoresis (sweating), nausea, vomiting, dyspnea (shortness of breath), lightheadedness, anxiety ("sense of doom").

**Atypical presentations (more common in women, elderly, diabetics):** Isolated dyspnea, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, back or jaw pain, epigastric discomfort without classic chest pain.

**Base rate:** ~805,000 MIs per year in the US. Incidence increases with age, male sex, family history, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity.

**Time-critical:** "Time is muscle." Reperfusion therapy (PCI or thrombolytics) most effective within first 90-120 minutes. CALL 911 — do NOT drive to the hospital.

**Pre-hospital:** Chew aspirin 325mg if not allergic. Sit upright. Stay calm. Note symptom onset time.

## Acute Ischemic Stroke

Sudden interruption of blood supply to the brain. About 87% of strokes are ischemic (clot), 13% hemorrhagic (bleeding).

**FAST assessment:**
- **F**ace: Facial droop (ask to smile)
- **A**rms: Arm weakness (ask to raise both arms)
- **S**peech: Speech difficulty (ask to repeat a phrase)
- **T**ime: Time to call 911

**Typical symptoms:** Sudden onset of unilateral weakness or numbness (face, arm, leg), speech difficulty (aphasia, dysarthria), visual disturbance (vision loss in one eye, double vision), severe headache with no known cause, confusion, difficulty walking/balance.

**Time-critical:** tPA (alteplase) effective within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Mechanical thrombectomy may extend window to 24 hours for large vessel occlusion. Note the time of symptom onset.

**Base rate:** ~795,000 strokes per year in the US. Risk factors: hypertension (most important), atrial fibrillation, diabetes, smoking, prior stroke/TIA.

## Anaphylaxis

Severe, potentially fatal systemic allergic reaction. Rapid onset (minutes to hours) after exposure to allergen.

**Typical symptoms:** Skin (urticaria/hives, flushing, itching, angioedema — 80-90% of cases), respiratory (throat tightness, stridor, wheezing, dyspnea, hoarseness), cardiovascular (hypotension, tachycardia, dizziness, syncope), GI (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea).

**Diagnostic criteria (Sampson):** Acute onset (minutes to hours) with involvement of skin/mucosal tissue AND at least one of: respiratory compromise, reduced BP, or end-organ dysfunction.

**Common triggers:** Foods (peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, milk, eggs), insect stings (Hymenoptera), medications (antibiotics, NSAIDs), latex.

**Immediate treatment:** Epinephrine IM (anterolateral thigh) — FIRST LINE, do not delay. 0.3-0.5mg (1:1000) adults, 0.01mg/kg children. Call 911. Position supine with legs elevated (unless respiratory distress). Be prepared for biphasic reaction (recurrence 1-72 hours).

## Meningitis

Inflammation of the meninges (membranes surrounding brain and spinal cord). Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency.

**Classic triad:** Fever, neck stiffness (nuchal rigidity), altered mental status. Full triad present in only ~45% of cases.

**Other symptoms:** Severe headache, photophobia, nausea/vomiting, Kernig sign (pain with knee extension when hip flexed), Brudzinski sign (involuntary hip flexion when neck flexed), petechial rash (suggests meningococcal).

**Bacterial vs. viral:** Bacterial: more rapid onset, higher fever, more toxic appearance, altered consciousness. Viral: more gradual, milder, headache prominent, typically self-limited.

**Time-critical:** Bacterial meningitis mortality 10-30% even with treatment. Antibiotics should be given within 1 hour of recognition. Do NOT delay antibiotics for LP if clinical suspicion is high.

## Pulmonary Embolism (PE)

Blood clot (usually from deep vein thrombosis in legs) lodges in pulmonary arteries.

**Typical symptoms:** Sudden-onset dyspnea (most common), pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia. May present with syncope or sudden death in massive PE.

**Risk factors (Virchow's triad):** Stasis (immobilization, long travel, surgery), endothelial injury (trauma, surgery), hypercoagulability (malignancy, pregnancy, OCP use, inherited thrombophilia).

**Wells criteria components:** Clinical signs of DVT, heart rate >100, immobilization/surgery in prior 4 weeks, prior DVT/PE, hemoptysis, malignancy, PE as likely or more likely than alternative diagnosis.

## Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)

Life-threatening complication of diabetes, most common in Type 1 diabetes but can occur in Type 2.

**Typical symptoms:** Polyuria, polydipsia, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, Kussmaul respirations (deep, rapid breathing), fruity breath odor, altered consciousness, dehydration signs.

**Diagnostic criteria:** Blood glucose >250 mg/dL, arterial pH <7.3, serum bicarbonate <18, anion gap >12, ketonemia/ketonuria.

**Common precipitants:** Infection (most common), medication non-adherence, new-onset diabetes, MI, surgery, drugs (steroids, SGLT2 inhibitors).

## Sepsis

Life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response to infection. Septic shock: sepsis + vasopressor requirement + lactate >2 despite adequate fluid resuscitation.

**qSOFA criteria (screening):** Respiratory rate >=22, altered mentation (GCS <15), systolic BP <=100.

**Common symptoms:** Fever OR hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, altered mental status, hypotension, mottled skin, decreased urine output, elevated lactate.

**Mortality:** Increases ~7.6% for every hour antibiotics are delayed.

## Acute Appendicitis

Inflammation of the appendix, the most common surgical emergency.

**Classic presentation:** Periumbilical pain migrating to right lower quadrant (McBurney point) over 12-24 hours, anorexia, nausea, low-grade fever. Pain worsens with movement, coughing.

**Physical exam:** RLQ tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, Rovsing sign (LLQ palpation causes RLQ pain), psoas sign, obturator sign.

**Atypical presentations:** Retrocecal appendix (back or flank pain), pelvic appendix (suprapubic pain, urinary symptoms), pregnancy (higher/lateral pain).

**Key:** Perforation risk increases after 48-72 hours of symptoms. Surgical consultation should not be delayed.
