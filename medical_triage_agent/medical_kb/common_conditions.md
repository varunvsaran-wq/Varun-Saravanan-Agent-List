# Common Medical Conditions Knowledge Base

## Upper Respiratory Infection (Common Cold)

Upper respiratory infections (URIs) are the most common acute illness in the outpatient setting. They are typically caused by rhinoviruses (30-50% of cases), coronaviruses (10-15%), or other respiratory viruses.

**Typical symptoms:** Nasal congestion, rhinorrhea (runny nose), sneezing, sore throat, mild cough, low-grade fever (uncommon in adults), malaise. Symptoms typically peak at days 2-3 and resolve within 7-10 days.

**Base rate:** Adults average 2-3 URIs per year. Children average 6-8 per year.

**Key differentiators from more serious conditions:**
- No high fever (>101.3°F / 38.5°C typically absent)
- No severe headache or facial pain (would suggest sinusitis)
- No significant shortness of breath (would suggest pneumonia or asthma)
- No unilateral sore throat with trismus (would suggest peritonsillar abscess)

**Self-care:** Rest, hydration, saline nasal rinses, acetaminophen or ibuprofen for comfort. Honey (age >1 year) may help cough.

**See a clinician if:** Symptoms worsen after day 5, persist beyond 10 days, high fever develops, significant ear pain, or shortness of breath.

## Influenza

Influenza is caused by influenza A or B viruses. Unlike the common cold, influenza has an abrupt onset and more systemic symptoms.

**Typical symptoms:** Sudden onset of high fever (100.4-104°F), chills, myalgia (body aches), headache, fatigue, dry cough, sore throat, nasal congestion. Duration typically 5-7 days for fever, cough may persist 2 weeks.

**Base rate:** Annual attack rate 5-15% in adults, higher in children.

**Red flags:** Difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain, confusion, severe vomiting, flu symptoms that improve then return with fever and worse cough (suggests secondary bacterial pneumonia).

**Risk groups for complications:** Age >65, age <5, pregnancy, immunosuppression, chronic lung/heart/kidney/liver disease, BMI >40.

## Tension-Type Headache

The most common primary headache disorder, with lifetime prevalence of approximately 80%.

**Typical symptoms:** Bilateral, pressing/tightening quality (non-pulsating), mild to moderate intensity, not aggravated by routine physical activity. Duration: 30 minutes to 7 days. No nausea/vomiting (mild nausea possible in chronic form). No photophobia AND phonophobia together (one alone may be present).

**Key differentiators:**
- Migraine: Usually unilateral, pulsating, moderate-severe, aggravated by activity, associated nausea/vomiting and photo/phonophobia
- Cluster headache: Severe unilateral periorbital pain, ipsilateral autonomic symptoms (tearing, nasal congestion), restlessness
- Secondary headaches (red flags): Thunderclap onset, fever with neck stiffness, new headache >50 years, progressive worsening, focal neurological signs, papilledema

**Self-care:** OTC analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, aspirin), stress management, adequate sleep, regular meals, posture correction. Avoid medication overuse (>15 days/month).

## Acute Gastroenteritis

Inflammation of the GI tract causing diarrhea and/or vomiting. Most commonly viral (norovirus, rotavirus) in developed countries.

**Typical symptoms:** Diarrhea (watery, non-bloody in viral), nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, low-grade fever, malaise. Viral: onset 12-48h after exposure, duration 1-3 days. Bacterial: may have bloody diarrhea, higher fever.

**Base rate:** Adults average 1-2 episodes per year.

**Key differentiators:**
- Bloody diarrhea suggests bacterial (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli O157:H7) or inflammatory bowel disease
- Severe abdominal pain with rigidity: surgical emergency (appendicitis, perforation)
- Persistent vomiting >48h or inability to keep fluids down: needs medical evaluation

**Self-care:** Oral rehydration (small frequent sips), bland diet when tolerated (BRAT not strictly necessary), avoid dairy initially. Bismuth subsalicylate may help.

**See a clinician if:** Bloody stool, fever >101.3°F, signs of dehydration (dark urine, dizziness, dry mouth), symptoms >3 days, recent antibiotic use, immunocompromised, age >65 or <5.

## Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) — Uncomplicated Cystitis

Infection of the lower urinary tract (bladder), most common in women. Caused primarily by E. coli (75-95% of cases).

**Typical symptoms:** Dysuria (burning on urination), urinary frequency, urgency, suprapubic discomfort, possibly hematuria (blood in urine). No fever, no flank pain (would suggest pyelonephritis).

**Base rate:** ~50% of women will have at least one UTI in their lifetime. Annual incidence in young women: ~12%.

**Risk factors:** Female sex, sexual activity, prior UTIs, spermicide use, menopause (atrophic vaginitis).

**Key differentiators:**
- Pyelonephritis: Fever, flank/back pain, nausea/vomiting in addition to lower tract symptoms
- Vaginitis: External dysuria, discharge, pruritus, no frequency/urgency
- STI (urethritis): Discharge, risk factors, gradual onset
- Interstitial cystitis: Chronic symptoms, negative cultures

**Requires clinical evaluation:** UTIs generally require antibiotic treatment. Empiric antibiotics (e.g., nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX) are standard of care. Do not delay treatment.

## Allergic Rhinitis

IgE-mediated inflammatory response of the nasal mucosa to environmental allergens.

**Typical symptoms:** Sneezing (often paroxysmal), watery rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, itchy nose/eyes/palate, post-nasal drip, watery/itchy eyes. May be seasonal (pollen) or perennial (dust mites, pet dander, mold).

**Base rate:** Affects 10-30% of adults and up to 40% of children.

**Key differentiators from URI:**
- Itching prominent (nose, eyes, palate) — absent in URI
- Clear, watery discharge (URI may become thick/colored)
- No fever
- Duration >10 days without worsening-then-improving pattern
- Seasonal pattern or identifiable triggers

## Musculoskeletal Low Back Pain

The most common cause of low back pain is mechanical/musculoskeletal in origin.

**Typical symptoms:** Aching or stiffness in the lower back, may radiate to buttocks or posterior thigh (not below knee unless radiculopathy), worse with activity or prolonged sitting, better with position changes. No neurological deficits.

**Base rate:** Lifetime prevalence 60-80%. Most episodes resolve within 4-6 weeks.

**Red flags (require urgent evaluation):**
- Cauda equina syndrome: Saddle anesthesia, bowel/bladder dysfunction, bilateral leg weakness
- Cancer: History of cancer, unexplained weight loss, age >50 with new onset, pain at rest/night
- Infection: Fever, IV drug use, recent procedure, immunosuppression
- Fracture: Significant trauma, osteoporosis, corticosteroid use

**Self-care:** Stay active (bed rest is NOT recommended), OTC analgesics, ice/heat, gentle stretching. Most cases resolve with conservative management.

## Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)

Functional GI disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with defecation or change in bowel habits.

**Rome IV criteria:** Recurrent abdominal pain, on average, at least 1 day/week in the last 3 months, associated with two or more of: related to defecation, associated with change in stool frequency, associated with change in stool form.

**Subtypes:** IBS-C (constipation predominant), IBS-D (diarrhea predominant), IBS-M (mixed).

**Typical symptoms:** Crampy abdominal pain (often lower abdomen), bloating, altered bowel habits, mucus in stool, symptoms often worse with stress or certain foods. NO nocturnal symptoms, NO weight loss, NO rectal bleeding (these suggest organic disease).

**Base rate:** Prevalence 10-15% of adults. Female:male ratio approximately 2:1.

**Key differentiators:**
- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Bloody diarrhea, weight loss, fever, nocturnal symptoms, elevated inflammatory markers
- Celiac disease: Consider if diarrhea-predominant, iron deficiency, family history
- Colon cancer: Age >50, rectal bleeding, weight loss, family history, change in caliber of stool
