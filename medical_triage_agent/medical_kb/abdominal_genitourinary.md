# Abdominal and Genitourinary Conditions

## Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

Chronic condition where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus.

**Typical symptoms:** Heartburn (burning retrosternal discomfort, worse after meals, lying down, or bending), regurgitation (acid taste in mouth), dysphagia. Extra-esophageal: chronic cough, laryngitis, dental erosions, asthma exacerbation.

**Base rate:** 20-30% of adults in Western countries experience weekly heartburn.

**Key differentiators:**
- Cardiac chest pain: Exertional, associated with dyspnea/diaphoresis, radiation to arm/jaw — always consider cardiac etiology first
- Peptic ulcer disease: Epigastric pain, may be relieved or worsened by eating, H. pylori or NSAID use
- Esophageal cancer: Dysphagia (progressive), weight loss, age >50

**Red flags (alarm features):** Dysphagia, odynophagia (painful swallowing), weight loss, GI bleeding, anemia, recurrent vomiting — warrant endoscopy.

**Self-care:** Elevate head of bed, avoid eating 2-3 hours before lying down, avoid trigger foods (spicy, fatty, citrus, caffeine, alcohol), weight loss if overweight, OTC antacids or H2 blockers for intermittent symptoms.

## Peptic Ulcer Disease

Mucosal erosions in the stomach or duodenum.

**Typical symptoms:** Epigastric pain (gnawing, burning), may be worse or better with food depending on location (gastric ulcers often worse with eating, duodenal ulcers often worse on empty stomach and improved with eating), nausea, bloating, early satiety.

**Causes:** H. pylori infection (60-70% of duodenal, 30-50% of gastric), NSAID use, less common: Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, stress ulcers in critically ill.

**Complications (require urgent evaluation):** Bleeding (hematemesis, melena, hematochezia), perforation (sudden severe abdominal pain, rigidity, free air on imaging), obstruction (vomiting, early satiety, weight loss).

## Kidney Stones (Nephrolithiasis)

Crystalline mineral deposits in the urinary tract.

**Typical symptoms:** Acute severe flank pain radiating to groin (renal colic), comes in waves (colicky), hematuria (gross or microscopic), nausea/vomiting, urinary urgency/frequency if stone is near bladder. Patient often restless, unable to find comfortable position.

**Base rate:** Lifetime prevalence 10-15%. Male:female ratio 2-3:1. Peak age 30-50.

**Key differentiators:**
- Pyelonephritis: Fever, CVA tenderness, pyuria, bacteriuria
- Appendicitis: Pain migrates to RLQ, anorexia, fever
- Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: Hypotension, pulsatile abdominal mass, age >60
- Ovarian torsion: Female, lower abdominal pain, may follow exertion

**Self-care (small stones <5mm):** Hydration (2-3L/day), NSAIDs for pain, alpha-blockers may help passage (medical expulsive therapy — requires prescription).

**See a clinician if:** Fever (suggests infected stone — emergency), intractable pain/vomiting, stone >5mm, single kidney, bilateral obstruction.

## Pyelonephritis (Upper UTI)

Bacterial infection of the kidney, usually ascending from lower urinary tract.

**Typical symptoms:** Fever, chills, flank/back pain (CVA tenderness), nausea/vomiting, malaise, PLUS lower urinary tract symptoms (dysuria, frequency, urgency).

**Key differentiator from cystitis:** Fever and flank pain distinguish upper from lower UTI. Cystitis has no systemic symptoms.

**Requires medical evaluation:** Always. Mild cases may be managed outpatient with oral antibiotics. Severe cases (sepsis, vomiting preventing oral intake, obstruction) require hospitalization and IV antibiotics.

## Cholecystitis

Inflammation of the gallbladder, usually due to gallstones obstructing the cystic duct.

**Typical symptoms:** Right upper quadrant or epigastric pain (often after fatty meal), lasting >4-6 hours (distinguishes from biliary colic which resolves sooner), nausea/vomiting, fever, Murphy sign (inspiratory arrest during RUQ palpation).

**Base rate:** Gallstones present in 10-15% of adults. Annual risk of cholecystitis in those with stones: ~1-2%.

**Risk factors (4 F's mnemonic):** Female, Forty (age >40), Fertile (multiparous), Fat (obesity). Also: rapid weight loss, Native American/Hispanic ethnicity, family history.

**Complications:** Gangrenous cholecystitis, perforation, cholangitis (fever + jaundice + RUQ pain = Charcot triad — emergency).
