# Mental Health Conditions

## Major Depressive Disorder

A mood disorder characterized by persistent depressed mood and/or loss of interest/pleasure.

**DSM-5 criteria:** Five or more of the following during a 2-week period (must include #1 or #2): (1) depressed mood, (2) markedly diminished interest/pleasure (anhedonia), (3) significant weight/appetite change, (4) insomnia or hypersomnia, (5) psychomotor agitation or retardation, (6) fatigue, (7) feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, (8) diminished concentration, (9) recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation.

**Base rate:** Lifetime prevalence ~17%. Annual prevalence ~7%. Female:male ratio 2:1.

**CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE:** Always screen for suicidal ideation. Ask directly — asking does NOT increase risk. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) or PHQ-9 question 9 are validated screening tools.

**Key differentiators:**
- Hypothyroidism: Fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation — check TSH
- Anemia: Fatigue, pallor, dyspnea on exertion — check CBC
- Vitamin D deficiency: Fatigue, mood changes, bone pain
- Bipolar disorder: History of manic/hypomanic episodes — critical to differentiate before treatment
- Grief/bereavement: Normal response, but persistent depressive disorder may develop

## Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

Excessive anxiety and worry about multiple events or activities, occurring more days than not for at least 6 months.

**Typical symptoms:** Excessive worry difficult to control, restlessness, easy fatigability, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance.

**Physical manifestations:** Palpitations, chest tightness, dyspnea, GI disturbance, headaches, dizziness, tremor, sweating — these often drive patients to seek medical evaluation for presumed physical causes.

**Base rate:** Lifetime prevalence ~6%. More common in women (2:1 ratio).

**Key differentiators:**
- Hyperthyroidism: Weight loss, heat intolerance, tremor, tachycardia — check TSH
- Pheochromocytoma: Episodic hypertension, headache, sweating, palpitations (rare)
- Cardiac arrhythmia: Palpitations, dizziness, syncope — ECG
- Substance use/withdrawal: Caffeine, stimulants, alcohol withdrawal, benzodiazepine withdrawal

## Panic Disorder

Recurrent unexpected panic attacks with persistent concern about additional attacks or maladaptive behavior changes.

**Typical panic attack symptoms (peak within minutes):** Palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, choking sensation, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, chills/hot flashes, paresthesias (tingling), derealization/depersonalization, fear of losing control, fear of dying.

**IMPORTANT:** Many of these symptoms overlap with cardiac and respiratory emergencies. First presentation of panic-like symptoms, especially in patients with cardiac risk factors, requires medical evaluation to rule out MI, PE, arrhythmia.

**Base rate:** Lifetime prevalence 2-3%. Peak onset late adolescence to mid-30s. Female:male ratio 2:1.
