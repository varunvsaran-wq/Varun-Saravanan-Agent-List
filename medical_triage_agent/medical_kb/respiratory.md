# Respiratory Conditions

## Pneumonia (Community-Acquired)

Infection of the lung parenchyma acquired outside of hospital settings.

**Typical symptoms:** Cough (productive with purulent sputum), fever/chills, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, fatigue, myalgia. Elderly may present atypically: confusion, falls, functional decline without classic respiratory symptoms.

**Common causative organisms:** Streptococcus pneumoniae (most common typical), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (most common atypical, younger adults), Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella, respiratory viruses (influenza, SARS-CoV-2, RSV).

**Base rate:** Annual incidence 5-11 per 1000 adults. Hospitalization rate increases significantly with age.

**Severity assessment (CURB-65):** Confusion, Urea >7, Respiratory rate >=30, Blood pressure (systolic <90 or diastolic <=60), Age >=65. Score 0-1: outpatient. Score 2: short inpatient or supervised outpatient. Score 3+: hospitalization, consider ICU.

**Key differentiators:**
- From URI/bronchitis: Fever, focal chest findings, dyspnea, higher HR, longer duration of productive cough
- From PE: PE has sudden onset, pleuritic pain without fever, risk factors for DVT
- From heart failure exacerbation: Bilateral crackles, peripheral edema, orthopnea, elevated BNP

## Asthma Exacerbation

Episodic reversible airway obstruction due to bronchospasm, airway inflammation, and mucus hypersecretion.

**Typical symptoms:** Wheezing (expiratory), dyspnea, chest tightness, cough (especially nocturnal or with exercise). Symptoms intermittent, triggered by allergens, cold air, exercise, respiratory infections, irritants.

**Severity classification of acute exacerbation:**
- Mild: Dyspnea with activity, speaks in sentences, HR <100, O2 sat >95%
- Moderate: Dyspnea at rest, speaks in phrases, HR 100-120, O2 sat 91-95%
- Severe: Dyspnea at rest, speaks in words, HR >120, O2 sat <91%, accessory muscle use
- Life-threatening: Unable to speak, drowsy/confused, silent chest, bradycardia, cyanosis

**Base rate:** ~8% of US adults, ~8% of US children.

**Self-care (mild exacerbation):** Short-acting beta-agonist (albuterol) inhaler, 2-4 puffs every 20 minutes for up to 1 hour. If no improvement, seek medical care. Identify and remove trigger if possible.

## Acute Bronchitis

Inflammation of the bronchial tubes, most commonly caused by viruses. Self-limited condition.

**Typical symptoms:** Cough (initially dry, may become productive), duration 1-3 weeks (cough may persist up to 8 weeks in some cases), mild dyspnea, chest soreness from coughing, low-grade fever, malaise.

**Key differentiators from pneumonia:** No focal chest findings on exam, no significant fever (>101.3°F), no tachycardia, no dyspnea at rest, normal O2 saturation.

**Important:** Antibiotics are NOT indicated for acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults. This is one of the most common causes of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing.

**Self-care:** Rest, hydration, honey for cough (age >1), OTC cough suppressants (limited evidence), acetaminophen/ibuprofen for discomfort.

## COVID-19

Respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

**Typical symptoms:** Fever, cough (usually dry), fatigue, myalgia, headache, sore throat, loss of taste/smell (more common in earlier variants), nasal congestion, diarrhea. Wide spectrum from asymptomatic to critical illness.

**Severity spectrum:** Mild (80%): upper respiratory symptoms, mild pneumonia. Moderate (15%): pneumonia with dyspnea, O2 sat 94-98%. Severe (5%): respiratory failure, shock, multi-organ dysfunction.

**Risk factors for severe disease:** Age >65, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, immunosuppression, chronic kidney disease.

**Self-care (mild cases):** Isolation, rest, hydration, acetaminophen for fever/discomfort, monitor O2 saturation if possible, seek care if dyspnea develops or O2 sat <94%.

## COPD Exacerbation

Acute worsening of respiratory symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

**Typical symptoms:** Increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume and/or purulence, increased cough, wheezing, chest tightness. May present with fever if infectious trigger.

**Common triggers:** Respiratory infections (viral most common, bacterial), air pollution, cold air, medication non-adherence.

**Anthonisen criteria for severity:** Type 1 (severe): all three cardinal symptoms (increased dyspnea, sputum volume, sputum purulence). Type 2 (moderate): two of three. Type 3 (mild): one of three plus URI symptoms, fever, or increased wheezing/cough.
